# Plant-Disease-Detection-with-Deployment
Built a deep learning model using ResNet to classify plant diseases across 15 categories (tomato, potato, pepper). Achieved high accuracy in detecting issues like bacterial spot and leaf mold. Deployed a Flask web app with OpenCV for real-time prediction and visualization.
